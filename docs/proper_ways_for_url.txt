Proper Ways for creating URLS

1. It is better to use hyphen ('-') than underscore (_) for multiple words in the urls
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello_world/ (Don't)
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/hello-world/ (Do)

2. URLs should be readable. We should be abe to guess the content of the URL just by seeing the URL
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/2/
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/2/home/
    
3. It is better not to use ids in the URL
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/jon/  (Do)
    http://127.0.0.1:8000/students/2/   (Don't)
